      Use buttons to the right to place bets, move through normal game play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to achieve highest hand with a value of 21 or less. Face cards have a
      value of 10. Aces have a value of 11 unless they cause the hand value to
      exceed 21 in which case they have a value of 1. All other cards have a
      value equal to the cards value. Player wins if their hand value exceeds
      the dealers hand and they have not "busted" by going over 21. Player also
      wins if they have not "busted" and the dealer has "busted."
    </p>
